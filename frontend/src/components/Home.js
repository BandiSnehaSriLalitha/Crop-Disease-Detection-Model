              Welcome to the world of intelligent farming! Our Crop Disease Detection Model is 
              designed to help farmers and plant lovers identify diseases in crops quickly and accurately. 
              By simply uploading an image, the system scans for signs of diseases and provides valuable insights 
              to protect your plants. This innovative approach ensures that you can take preventive measures in time 
              to save your crops and boost productivity.
